    <p>
      I've been building software for over 8 years, with the last 5 years spent focused on web
      development, especially in SaaS environments. I work mainly with Angular and .NET, and I enjoy
      jumping between front end and back end when the project calls for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, the front end is where I'm strongest, it's where I get to combine engineering with
      user experience and bring ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm aiming for front-end roles, but I'm always up for any challenge that lets me build
      something useful and well crafted.
