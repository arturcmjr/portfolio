  <p>
    I've been building software for over 8 years, with the last 5 years spent focused on web
    development, especially in SaaS environments. I work mainly with Angular and .NET, and I enjoy
    jumping between front end and back end when the project calls for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the front end is where I'm strongest, it's where I get to combine engineering with
    user experience and bring ideas to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm aiming for front-end roles, but I'm always up for any challenge that lets me build something
    useful and well crafted.
